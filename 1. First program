//Starting the program
//We will be writing the first code
//First we begin with declaration of the class type. Here the 'namespace' will mean the class type and 'std' is standard 'using' is simply a calling. We here, call the standard namespace.
using namespace std;

//The second part is declaration of the main executable function.
//We generate the command 'include' ordering it to include. 'iostream' is simply the library that we are supposed to include or call.
#include <iostream>

//The main body starts with either 'int' or 'float' or 'str' whichever kind of output we want from the console.
//It has the 'main()' which indicates here is the main body you are absolutely going to have to compile them computer.
int main()

//The beginning and closing of the body has to start and end with '{' and '}'. It will mark the body.
{
	//the next is the command 'cout' which means command out to console. This is printf asking the computer to print a string we have given.
	//The use of '<<' is indicative of what we are writing in, for example a double inverted comma (" ") or a statement.
	cout << "This is my first program in Dev-C++.";
	
	//There always has to be a written value which is what a 'return' command is for. 'return 0' simply means return nothing different than the code.
	return 0;
}
//To execute the program, the 'Execute' button will be used.
//The comments are written in either double backward slashes or written in between '/*' and '*/'.
